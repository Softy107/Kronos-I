# Kronos I
An Upright piano I bought for soundfont recording. Detuned 6 keys for a Bell like sound.
Here is where I got the idea from : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3fMBdLTMYM&t=244s / at 4:04

A soundfont for free use in Black MIDI videos, editing, or other uses.

Contains a total of :
- 10 samples (C, F#)
- 5 Versions to choose from
- 3 Cherry piano samples for bass boost
- Filter cutoff for higher keys
